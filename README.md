<!-- Think of your README.md as your landing page for your project. Before a viewer dives into your files, what do you want them to know about your project? Here are some recommendations for your project README.mds:
Give a brief overview of what is in each folder in your repo, so a viewer knows how to navigate around.
Give a summary of what your project is all about:
Problem Statement: What question(s) did you aim to answer through your analysis?
Data: What data did you use? How did you acquire it?
Consider adding a data dictionary that explains what is in each column of your dataset
Data Processing: What steps did you take to clean and transform your data before more formal analysis
Results/Findings: What did you find throughout your analysis? This is a great place to add some of your visualizations
Conclusions/Recommendations: Are there any conclusions or recommendations that can be made based on your analysis?
Next Steps: If you feel like there is more that could be done with your data to investigate your initial questions, what would you do? Are there other datasets you could add? Other cleaning or tranformation steps? -->
